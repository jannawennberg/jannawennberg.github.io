Welcome! I am a graduate student in the Psychology Department at UC San Diego, working 
with Dr. John Serences. As we navigate rich perceptual environments, we have the ability to select and hold certain information in mind (or working memory). I am interested in uncovering how populations of neurons flexibly code this information, as well as how different brain regions work together in order to support this capability. To do this, I use a combination of behavior, fMRI, and computational modeling. 

I am also an open science enthusiast! During my graduate career, I have presented in lab meetings and at conferences about how scientific reforms such as preregistration and registered reports also serve as valuable training tools. 

Outside of the lab, I love to clear my mind with a long run, curl up with a [good book](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33411562-janna-wennberg), play guitar, cook, watch sweet TV shows, and spend time with people I love.
